## Basic Foundations

### Etymology of Words (Roots and Affixes)

**Indo-European languages (印欧语系)** 有两个起源地：**立陶宛地区**和**地中海东岸的闪含语系地区**——来源于 **Phoenician (腓尼基语)**

西北欧的地区大部分是来源于立陶宛语系，地区交流促成了主要的 **Germanic (日耳曼)**、**Celtic (凯尔特)**、**Slavic (斯拉夫)** 语系（B.C. 9c - A.D. 0c）；现代欧洲语言**文字**的 ancestor 是**腓尼基字母**，希腊人在腓尼基字母的基础上创造出希腊字母，形成了 **Greek (古希腊语)**，之后又被意大利地区古罗马和拉丁人学习形成了 **Latin (拉丁语)**；希腊语和拉丁语不注重语法和介词等，用**词根词缀**即可表示复杂的信息

![alt text](img/image-2.png)

罗马帝国扩张后，拉丁语逐渐取代古希腊语，欧洲西边大部分讲拉丁语，东边讲希腊语；英国虽处于西边，但并未全部被拉丁语辐射到，仍然是凯尔特人为主（A.D. 0c - 5c）

在罗马帝国末期，日耳曼人入侵凯尔特，凯尔特人被迫逃离，与现代英语几乎无关系，而英语则是属于**日耳曼语族**，与德国、荷兰有相同的起源. 此时被视为英语的起源，盎格鲁撒克逊的**古英语**. 之后英语又被讲另一种日耳曼语的维京人入侵，融合的英语形成了**比较完善的语法结构**，但**失去了日耳曼复合构词的变化**（也就是为什么同是日耳曼语族，英语中的复合构词要比德语和荷兰语少得多）（5c - 10c）；罗马分裂后，拉丁语衍生成多种语言，例如法国、西班牙、意大利等，但 French 追求自己的一套 affix 方法，所以现在的西语和意大利语相比于法语而言更贴近拉丁语. 这些语言被统称为 **Romance Language (罗曼语族/罗马语族/拉丁语族)**. 此时已经很少有地区会讲拉丁语了

中世纪（10c）和近代现代（14c -）时期，英国先后发生了法国入侵和文艺复兴. 法国（诺曼法）入侵带来了大量**法语词汇**（本质是来源于拉丁语，但词缀拓展与拉丁语略有不同），文艺复兴时期都认为**拉丁语是代表着学术文明和高等教育**，而**日耳曼语象征着野蛮和低劣**，所以有大量**学术名词**都是来源于**拉丁语**和**希腊语**，这导致了现代英语的大量词汇会与罗曼语族的语言（如法语、意大利语、西班牙语等）有更多相似之处

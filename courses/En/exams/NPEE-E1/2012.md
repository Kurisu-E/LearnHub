##### Section II&emsp;Reading Comprehension

###### Part A

*Text 3*:

> **Para.2**&emsp;Consequently, discovery claims should be thought of as protoscience. Similar to newly staked mining claims, they are full of potential. But it takes collective [scrutiny](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/scrutiny.html#entry1.1-1) and acceptance to transform a discovery claim into a mature discovery. This is the [credibility](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/credibility.html#entry1.1-1) process, through which the individual researcher's *me*, *here, *now* becomes the community's *anyone*, *anywhere*, *anytime*. Objective knowledge is the goal, not the starting point.
> **Para.3**&emsp;Once a discovery claim becomes public, the discoverer receives intellectual credit. But, unlike with mining claims, the community takes control of hat happens next. Within the complex social structure off the scientific community, researchers make discoveries; editors and reviewers act as gatekeepers by controlling the publication process; other scientists use the new finding to suit their own purposes; and finally, the public (including other scientists) receives the new discovery and possibly accompanying technology. As a discovery claim [works its way](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/work_one's_way.html#entry1.1-1) through the community, the interaction and confrontation between shared and competing beliefs about the science and the technology involved transforms an individual's discovery claim into the community's credible discovery.

**T.32**: It can be inferred from Paragraph 2 that the credibility process requires

| A. strict inspection.         |
| :---------------------------- |
| **B. shared efforts.** |
| **C. individual wisdom.**     |
| **D. persistent innovation.** |

**T.33**: Paragraph 3 shows that a discovery claim becomes credible after it

| A. has attracted the attention of the general public.       |
| :---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **B. has been examined by the scientific community.** |
| **C. has received recognition from editors and reviewers.** |
| **D. has been frequently quoted by peer scientists.**       |

- So [when it comes time to](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/when_it_comes_time_to.html#entry1.1-1) pick up a location for their new Airbnb, a host needs to know where a property is likely to be [in demand](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/in_demand.html#entry1.1-1).

When will bookings [drop off](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/drop_off.html#entry2.1-1), and when will they [spike](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/spike.html#entry2.2-1)?

- Rosenberg offers a [host](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/host.html#entry4.1-1) of examples of the social cure in action.

- one [billboard](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/billboard.html#entry1.1-1) campaign pleads
- public-health advocates ought to [take a page from advertisers](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/take_a_page_from_someone.html#entry1.1-1), so skilled at applying peer pressure
- the most [glaring](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/glaring.html#entry1.1-3) flaw
- Far less [certain](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/certain.html#entry1.1-3b) is how successfully experts and [bureaucrats](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/bureaucrat.html#entry1.1-1) can select our peer groups and steer their activities in [virtuous](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/virtuous.html#entry1.1-1b) directions.
- the teacher [breaks up](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/break_up.html#entry2.2-1) the troublemakers
- The [tactic](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/tactic.html#entry1.1-1) never really works.
- [When it comes to](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/when_it_comes_to.html#entry1.1-1) ratings, Airbnb guests have high standards.
- What does this mean for a host's [bottom line](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/bottom_line.html#entry2.1-2a)?

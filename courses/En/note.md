## Basic Foundations

### Entries

An [entry](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/entry.html#entry1.1-4b(5)) is a single word or phrase, along with its definition, pronunciation, and example sentences. 或称词条 / 词目

Entries include:

- A **main entry or entry word** 主条目 / 主词条 refers to letters or a combination of such letters including [punctuation mark](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/punctuation_mark.html#entry1.1-1) and [diacritics](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/diacritic.html#entry1.1-1) where needed. In a dictionary it is usually in boldface [type](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/type.html#entry1.1-2c) and set [flush](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/flush.html#entry5.1-4b(1)) with the left-hand margin of each column of [type](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/type.html#entry1.1-2d).
- **Variants in the styling of compound words** 变种复合词 in English is frequent and widespread. It is often completely acceptable to choose freely among:
  - **[Open compounds](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/open_compound.html#entry1.1-1)**, such as *life style*
  - **[Hyphenated compounds](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/hyphenated_compound.html#entry1.1-1)**, such as *life-style*
  - **[Closed](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/closed_compound.html#entry1.1-1)/[Solid compounds](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/solid_compound.html#entry1.1-1)**, such as *lifestyle*
- **Homographs** 同形异义词 are words that are spelled the same but have different meanings and/or different pronunciations. In a dictionary, they are often distinguished by [superscript](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/superscript.html#entry1.1-1) numerals preceding each word. Homographs are created in three ways:
  - Homographs are derived from **the same root**, such as [*melt* entry 1](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/melt.html#entry2.1-1) and [*melt* entry 2](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/melt.html#entry2.1-1).
  - Homographs are **unrelated** beyond the accident of spelling, such as [*pine* entry 1](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/pine.html#entry1.1-1) and [*pine* entry 2](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/pine.html#entry2.1-1)
  - Homographs are derived from **an earlier homograph** by [**functional shift**](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/functional_shift.html#entry1.1-1), such as [noun usage of *superscript*](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/superscript.html#entry1.1-1) and [adjective usage of *superscript*](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/superscript.html#entry1.1-1).
- **The centered dots** 间隔符 within entry words indicate division points at which a hyphen may be put at the end of a line of printing or writing. Centered dots are not shown after a single initial letter or before a single terminal letter because printers [seldom](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/seldom.html#entry1.1-1) cut off a single letter. A double hyphen at the end of a line stands for a hyphen that [belongs](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/belong.html#entry1.1-3) at that point in a hyphenated word and that is retained when the word is written as a unit on one line.
- **[Run-on](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/run-on.html#entry2.1-1) entries** 续写词条 following the defined senses of a main entry, could be:
  - One or more **derivatives** or a **homograph** with a different functional label, such as *[slay](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/slay.html) — [slayer](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/slayer.html)*. They are not defined since their meanings are readily derivable from the meaning of the root word.
  - One or more **phrases** containing the entry word or an inflected form of it, such as *[hole](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/hole.html) — [in the hole](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/hole.html#in_the_hole)*. They are defined since their meanings are more than the sum of the meanings of their elements.
- **Pronunciation** 发音 is indicated between a pair of reversed virgules `\ \` following the entry word
- **Functional labels** 功能标签 indicate **parts of speech** (such as *noun*, *intransitive verb*, etc.) or some other **functional classification** (such as *abbreviation*, *combining form*, etc.). Labeling a verb as transitive, however, does not preclude occasional intransitive use (as in absolute constructions, such as "Weather permitting")
- **Inflected forms** 屈折变化
  - **Noun**
  - **Verbs**
  - **Adjectives & Adverbs**
- **Capitalization** 大写
- **Attributive nouns** 定语名词
- **Usage labels** 用法标签
  - **Temporal labels**
    - **[obsolete](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/obsolete.html#entry1.1-1a)** means that there is no evidence of use since 1755.
    - **[archaic](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/archaic.html#entry1.1-1)** means that a word or sense once in common use is found today only [sporadically](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/sporadically.html#entry1.1-1) or in special contexts
  - **Regional labels**
  - **[Stylistic](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/stylistic.html#entry1.1-1) labels**
    - **[slang](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/slang.html#entry1.1-2)**
    - **nonstandard**
    - **[disparaging](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/disparaging.html#entry1.1-1)**, **offensive**, **obscene**, **vulgar**
  - **Subject labels**
- **Illustrations of usage** 用法示例和插图
- **Definitions** 定义
  - **Usage notes** introduced by a right arrow `→` give supplementary information about such matters as idiom, syntax, semantic relationship, and status.
    - **used ...**
    - **called also** calls attention to one or more terms with the same denotation as the main entry.
  - **Division of senses** reflects something of their semantic relationship, but it does not evaluate senses or set up a [hierarchy](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/hierarchy.html#entry1.1-5) of importance among them. The order of senses is historical.
    - **such as** indicates that the following subsenses are typical or significant examples, while its absence indicates that the following subsenses which follow are [exhaustive](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/exhaustive.html#entry1.1-1).
    - **especially** is used to introduce the most common meaning [subsumed](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/subsume.html#entry1.1-1) in the more general preceding definition.
    - **specifically** is used to introduce a common but highly restricted meaning subsumed in the more general preceding definition.
    - **also** is used to introduce a meaning that is closely related to but may be considered less important than the preceding sense.
    - **broadly** is used to introduce an extended or wider meaning of the preceding definition.
  - **Self-explanatory** definitions are not repeated. Such as the entry *[picked](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/picked.html)* has no definition in such contexts as "picked apples", which is defined as "to gather by plucking" in [*pick* entry 1 sense 3a](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/pick.html#entry1.1-3a).
- **Cross-Reference** 交叉引用 has four different kinds used in the dictionary.
  - **directional** cross-reference that follows a right arrow `→` begins with *see* or *compare*.
    - ***compare*** cross-reference is regularly appended to a definition.
    - ***see*** cross-reference may stand alone.
  - **synonymous** cross-reference  that follows a boldface colon may stand alone as the only definitional matter for an entry or for a sense or subsense of an entry.
  - **[cognate](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/cognate.html#entry1.1-3b)** cross-reference follows an italic ***spelling of***
  - **inflectional** cross-reference follows an italic label that identifies an entry as an inflected form of the original entry.

### Etymology of Words (Roots and Affixes)

![alt text](img/image.png)
![alt text](img/image-1.png)

**Indo-European languages (印欧语系)** 有两个起源地：**立陶宛地区**和**地中海东岸的闪含语系地区**——来源于 **Phoenician (腓尼基语)**

西北欧的地区大部分是来源于立陶宛语系，地区交流促成了主要的 **Germanic (日耳曼)**、**Celtic (凯尔特)**、**Slavic (斯拉夫)** 语系（B.C. 9c - A.D. 0c）；现代欧洲语言**文字**的 ancestor 是**腓尼基字母**，希腊人在腓尼基字母的基础上创造出希腊字母，形成了 **Greek (古希腊语)**，之后又被意大利地区古罗马和拉丁人学习形成了 **Latin (拉丁语)**；希腊语和拉丁语不注重语法和介词等，用**词根词缀**即可表示复杂的信息

![alt text](img/image-2.png)

罗马帝国扩张后，拉丁语逐渐取代古希腊语，欧洲西边大部分讲拉丁语，东边讲希腊语；英国虽处于西边，但并未全部被拉丁语辐射到，仍然是凯尔特人为主（A.D. 0c - 5c）

在罗马帝国末期，日耳曼人入侵凯尔特，凯尔特人被迫逃离，与现代英语几乎无关系，而英语则是属于**日耳曼语族**，与德国、荷兰有相同的起源. 此时被视为英语的起源，盎格鲁撒克逊的**古英语**. 之后英语又被讲另一种日耳曼语的维京人入侵，融合的英语形成了**比较完善的语法结构**，但**失去了日耳曼复合构词的变化**（也就是为什么同是日耳曼语族，英语中的复合构词要比德语和荷兰语少得多）（5c - 10c）；罗马分裂后，拉丁语衍生成多种语言，例如法国、西班牙、意大利等，但 French 追求自己的一套 affix 方法，所以现在的西语和意大利语相比于法语而言更贴近拉丁语. 这些语言被统称为 **Romance Language (罗曼语族/罗马语族/拉丁语族)**. 此时已经很少有地区会讲拉丁语了

中世纪（10c）和近代现代（14c -）时期，英国先后发生了法国入侵和文艺复兴. 法国（诺曼法）入侵带来了大量**法语词汇**（本质是来源于拉丁语，但词缀拓展与拉丁语略有不同），文艺复兴时期都认为**拉丁语是代表着学术文明和高等教育**，而**日耳曼语象征着野蛮和低劣**，所以有大量**学术名词**都是来源于**拉丁语**和**希腊语**，这导致了现代英语的大量词汇会与罗曼语族的语言（如法语、意大利语、西班牙语等）有更多相似之处

> **Para.2**&emsp;Consequently, discovery claims should be thought of as protoscience. Similar to newly staked mining claims, they are full of potential. But it takes collective [scrutiny](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/scrutiny.html#entry1.1-1) and acceptance to transform a discovery claim into a mature discovery. This is the [credibility](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/credibility.html#entry1.1-1) process, through which the individual researcher's *me*, *here, *now* becomes the community's *anyone*, *anywhere*, *anytime*. Objective knowledge is the goal, not the starting point.
> **Para.3**&emsp;Once a discovery claim becomes public, the discoverer receives intellectual credit. But, unlike with mining claims, the community takes control of hat happens next. Within the complex social structure off the scientific community, researchers make discoveries; editors and reviewers act as gatekeepers by controlling the publication process; other scientists use the new finding to suit their own purposes; and finally, the public (including other scientists) receives the new discovery and possibly accompanying technology. As a discovery claim [works its way](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/work_one's_way.html#entry1.1-1) through the community, the interaction and confrontation between shared and competing beliefs about the science and the technology involved transforms an individual's discovery claim into the community's credible discovery.

**T.32**: It can be inferred from Paragraph 2 that the credibility process requires

| A. strict inspection.         |
| :---------------------------- |
| **B. shared efforts.** |
| **C. individual wisdom.**     |
| **D. persistent innovation.** |

**T.33**: Paragraph 3 shows that a discovery claim becomes credible after it

| **B. has been examined by the scientific community.** |
| **C. has received recognition from editors and reviewers.** |
| **D. has been frequently quoted by peer scientists.**       |

**Part B**:

> **Para.2**&emsp;Yet this enormous resource is not contributing enough to today's global challenges, including climate change, security, sustainable development and health. These issues all have root causes in human behavior: all require behavioral change and social innovations, as well as technological development. Stemming climate change, for example, is as much about changing consumption patterns and promoting tax acceptance as it is about developing clean energy. Humanity has the necessary agro-technological tools to eradicate hunger, from genetically engineered crops to artificial fertilizers. Here, too, the problems are social: the organization and distribution of food, heath, and prosperity..
> **Para.3**&emsp;**(T.42)**____ This is a shame—the community should be grasping the opportunity to raise its influence in the real word. To paraphrase the great social scientist Joseph Schumpeter: there is no radical innovation without creative destruction.

| A. It could be that we are evolving too communities of social scientists: one that is discipline-oriented and publishing in highly specialized journals, and one that is problem-oriented and publishing elsewhere, such as policy briefs. |
| :-- |
| **D. The solution is to change the mindset of the academic community, and what it considers to be its main goal. Global challenges and social innovation ought to receive much more attention from scientists, especially the young ones.** |
| **F. Despite these factors, many social scientists seem [reluctant](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/reluctant.html#entry1.1-1) to tackle such problems. And in Europe, some are [up in arms](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/arm.html#up_in_arms.1-1) over a proposal to drop a specific funding category for social-science research and to integrate it within [cross-cutting](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/cross-cut.html#entry1.1-1) topics of sustainable development.**      |

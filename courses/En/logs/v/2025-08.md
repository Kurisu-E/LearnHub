- You cannot buy [class](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/class.html#entry1.1-2), as the old saying goes, and these [upstart](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/upstart.html#entry2.1-1) entrepreneurs cannot buy their prizes the prestige of the Nobels.
- The new awards are an [exercise](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/exercise.html#entry1.1-4) in self-promotion for those behind them
- They could cement the [status quo](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/status_quo.html#entry1.1-1) of [peer-reviewed](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/peer-review.html#entry1.1-1) research.

- But the Nobel Foundation's limit of three recipients per prize, each of whom must still be living, has long been [outgrown](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/outgrow.html#entry1.1-2) by the collaborative nature of modern research—as will be [demonstrated](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/demonstrate.html#entry1.1-1) by the inevitable row over who is ignored when it comes to acknowledging the discovery of the Higgs boson.
- [As much as](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/as_much_as.html#entry2.1-1) some scientists may complain about the new awards, two things seem clear.

- The first person to suggest that light has a finite speed was [Danish](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/Danish.html#entry1.1-1) astronomer Ole Rømer while measuring the orbital period of [Io](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/Io.html#entry1.1-2) — one of [Jupiter](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/Jupiter.html#entry1.1-2)'s [moons](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/moon.html#entry1.1-1c).
- Rømer's leap of [intuition](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/intuition.html#entry1.1-2) sowed the [relativistic](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/relativistic.html#entry1.1-1) fruits that Einstein eventually reaped.
- However, no one at the time had the [faintest](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/faint.html#entry1.1-1b) [clue](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/clue.html#entry1.1-2) about the speed-of-light's magnitude, so Rømer couldn't say with any certainty whether the time delay between Jupiter and Earth was even measurable.
- This animation **isn't** drawn [to scale](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/scale.html#to_scale.1-1).
- This means during one [revolution](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/revolution.html#entry1.1-1a(2)) of Io, the distance between Earth and Jupiter doesn't change by much — [relatively speaking](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/relatively.html#relatively_speaking.1-1).
- Rømer knew that Earth and Jupiter don't usually share a [rest](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/rest.html#entry1.1-2b) frame.
- Suppose Jupiter is [at rest](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/rest.html#at_rest.1-2) in a reference frame.
- Worldlines on spacetime diagrams will guide us through the [mind-bending](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/mind-bending.html#entry1.1-1) universe of relativistic phenomena, so we'll try to prepare for this by using the spacetime diagram to work out $T_\text{obs}$ [in terms of](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/term.html#in_terms_of.1-1) the actual period $T_\text{Io}$.
- The [denominator](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/denominator.html#entry1.1-1) is always greater than $1$.

- After establishing that light travels with a finite speed and discovering [Fraunhofer diffraction](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/Fraunhofer_diffraction.html#entry1.1-1), $19^\text{th}$-century scientists had [every](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/every.html#entry1.1-4) reason to believe that light was a wave. Like sound traveling through air, or shock waves through Earth's [crust](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/crust.html#entry1.1-3b), light appeared to be a disturbance in a medium it was traveling through. They called this medium [luminiferous](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/luminiferous.html#entry1.1-1) [aether](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/aether.html#entry1.1-3a), which was thought to [permeate](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/permeate.html#entry1.2-1) all of space.

- An obvious question they asked to [get to the bottom of](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/get_to_the_bottom_of.html#entry1.1-1) this mystery is, “At what speed is the luminiferous aether traveling?”, or rather “What speed are we traveling at relative to it?”
- In the $1880$s, [experimentalists](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/experimentalist.html#entry1.1-1) Albert Michelson and Edward Morley set out to answer this question. Their idea was simple — if Earth is moving with respect to the aether, then we should be able to detect an [asymmetry](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/asymmetry.html#entry1.1-1) in how long it takes to send a light signal one way versus another.
- was a straightforward extension of their recreational biking [misadventures](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/misadventure.html#entry1.1-1).
- light takes different amounts of time to propagate the same distance along [perpendicular](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/perpendicular.html#entry1.1-1b) directions
- they built a device called [**interferometer**](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/interferometer.html#entry1.1-1) with two arms and a [coherent](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/coherent.html#entry1.1-3b) light source. They use a [beam splitter](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/beam_splitter.html#entry1.1-1), a special kind of optical device made from metal-coated [prisms](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/prism.html#entry1.1-2a).
- Michelson and Morley would detect interference (a mismatch between the waves' peaks and [troughs](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/trough.html#entry1.1-3)) between the two beams.
- The beams [accrue](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/accrue.html#entry1.2-1) a detectable wavelength difference quickly.
- The wavelength misalignment (also known as "decoherence") is definitely above the detection [threshold](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/threshold.html#entry1.1-3b).
- Out interferometer was the right size to detect such a [minute](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/minute.html#entry2.1-1) effect.
- Then, in $1905$, a young German patent clerk named Einstein [posited](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/posit.html#entry1.1-2) that, indeed, the length of an interferometer's arms might actually depend on how fast Earth moves around the Sun.
- Fractions are built [out of](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/out_of.html#entry1.1-2) parts that are equal in size.
- Equal-sized parts are the [building blocks](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/building_block.html#entry1.1-1) of fractions.

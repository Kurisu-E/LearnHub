## Week 1

### 1&emsp;Astronomy as a Science

This chapter includes:

- Introduction and logistics
- The oldest science
- Astronomy as a science
- Messengers from the universe

Notes:

- The oldest science:
  - An early 30-m telescope
  - Ancient greece: Ptolemaic system
  - Mayans - astrology
  - Copernicus: proposes that the Sun and not the Earth is in the center of the system
  - Tycho Brache: in his observatory called Uraniborg, did most precise measurements at that time, the really first observational astronomer
  - Kepler: probably the first modern astronomic method: Kepler's laws, the planets orbiting on ellipses around the Sun
  - Galileo: heard about the telescope from sailors, the first man to use the telescope to observe the sky: the phases of Venus, mountains on the moon
- Astronomy as a science

  how can you possibly infer general things about the universal things?

  - Fundamental limits to measurements and selection effects
- Messengers from the universe: what we measure

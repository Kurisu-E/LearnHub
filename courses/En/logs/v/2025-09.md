Parts of the ceremony involve [ritual](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/ritual.html#entry1.1-1) hair cutting, tying cotton threads soaked in holy water around the bride's and groom's wrists, and lighting a candle around a circle of happily married and respected couples to bless the [union](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/union.html#entry1.1-1a(2)).

- Half a century of town and country planning has enabled it to retain an [enviable](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/enviable.html#entry1.1-1) rural coherence, while still permitting low-density urban living. There is no doubt of the alternative—the [corrupted](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/corrupt.html#entry1.1-2) landscape of southern Portugal, Spain or Ireland.

**Word of the Day: [carp](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/carp.html#entry1.1)** | *verb* | KAHRP

To *carp* is to complain in an annoying way.

**Vocabulary Builder**:

- **BENE** is Latin for "well." A [*benefit*](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/benefit.html#entry1.1.1) is a good result or effect. Something [*beneficial*](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/beneficial.html#entry1.1-1) produces good results or effects. The Latin root can be heard in other languages as well: "Good!" or "Fine!" in Spanish is "Bueno!"; in French, it's "Bon!"; and in Italian, just say "Bene!"
  - [The moment](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/the_moment.html#entry1.1-1) the [bishop](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/bishop.html#entry1.1-1a) had finished his [*benediction*](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/benediction.html#entry1.1-1), she [squeezed](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/squeeze.html#entry1.2-1) quickly [out of](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/out_of.html#entry1.1-1a(1)) her row and [darted](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/dart.html#entry2.2-1) out the cathedral's side entrance.

  - An anonymous [*benefactor*](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/benefactor.html#entry1.1-1) had given $15 million to establish an ecological institute at the university.

    > *Beneficiary* is often used in connection with life insurance, but it shows up in many other contexts as well. A college may be the beneficiary of a private donation. Your uncle's will may make a church his sole beneficiary, in which case all his money and property will go to it when he dies. In a more general way, a restaurant may be the beneficiary when the one across the street closes down and its whole lunch crowd starts coming in.
  - In those financially desperate years, the young couple was saved only by the [*benevolence*](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/benevolence.html#entry1.1-2) of her elderly great-uncle.
    > *volence*, from *volentem* (nominative *volens*), present participle of Latin root *velle* "wish." TO be *benevolent*, it helps to have money, but it's not necessary; kind assistance of a nonfinancial sort may turn out to be lifesaving benevolence as well.

[*Amiable*](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/amiable.html#entry1.1-1a) means "friendly or good-natured," and [*amigo*](http://localhost:5500/En/dict/amigo.html#entry1.1-1) is Spanish for "friend."
